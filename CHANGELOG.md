## v0.1.1

- refactor: import the shared library from its new root module path `github.com/bborbe/maintainer` (was `github.com/bborbe/maintainer/lib`) and bump to `@v0.45.0`. The maintainer repo flattened `lib/` to its root to match the `bborbe/agent` layout. No behavior change.

## v0.1.0

- Extracted from the `bborbe/maintainer` monorepo (`watcher/github-release`) into a standalone
  publish-only repository. Shared code now comes from the versioned
  `github.com/bborbe/maintainer/lib` module instead of a local `replace`. Builds and
  publishes `docker.io/bborbe/github-release-watcher:<version>` via `make buca`.
